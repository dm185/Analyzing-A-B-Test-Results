For this project, I analyzed A/B test results. This is the third project in Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program. 
The steps performed in this project involved doing some calculations on proportions, 
determining the null and alternative hypothesis, calculating p-values and running a series of logistic regression models. 
This project should now serve as a good template and guide to follow along when doing similar projects. Coding in this project
made use of both the Numpy and Pandas Python libraries along with Matplotlib for creating histograms.
